- Hi, Iâ€™m Filip, an ex-bank mSME relationship manager who has fallen in love with website building and coding
- I've always been tempted to create websites, but because of my work I didn't have time for that. In 2020 came an unexpected sabbatical and I decided learn to how to code. I studied every day. I learned HTML, CSS and started working on JS and WP skill's. When I returned to the bank, I could no longer be there. I was  thinking allday's about what I will do when I turn on Visual Studio Code again. 
- Shortly afterwards, I got a chance as a junior at the digital agency Sharkani, where I still work as Head of Development. I like the diversity of projects the most. In my position, I am responsible for finding suitable solutions for clients. This allows me to spend a lot of time learning. I also take care of creating the wireframe and in cooperation with the designers the resulting UI&UX, it is necessary for me to develop my skill's in this direction as well.
- In the last quarter of 2021, I was an intern at a power play studio, where I tried out tools like docker, zeplin and VUE.js. It was a great experience to look inside a big project. In addition to my work, I am currently mainly interested in VUE.js.
